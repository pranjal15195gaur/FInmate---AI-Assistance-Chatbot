# FInmate - AI Assistance Chatbot
  Hereâ€™s a concise, single-paragraph description for your FinMate project to be added to your GitHub repository:  FinMate is an AI-powered chatbot developed during the Finnovate Hackathon 2024 at IIT Gandhinagar to assist bank users with various tasks such as answering queries, checking loan eligibility, downloading forms, and navigating to required websites. The project utilizes Elasticsearch and tokenization for query recognition and API predictions, and integrates Google Cloud services like Google Translate and Google Voice API for speech recognition and translation. Built with Next.js for the frontend and Flask and Python for the backend, FinMate also scrapes web data to provide relevant form download links and website URLs. This project showcases the practical application of AI in fintech to enhance user experience and operational efficiency in banking.
